# Vectors
Intro to Vectors,

In the code, there is a double vector named delivery_order that is storing the prices of some food items.

There is also a double variable named total thatâ€™s already declared and initialized.

Write a for loop that iterates through the delivery_order vector (from 0 to delivery_order.size()). And add each order to total during each iteration.
